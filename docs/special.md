# Idea behind the name NERGE
Nerge is a portmanteau of "New" and "Verge". It represents the idea of a protocol that represents a new generation of DeFi infrastructure — one built not on speculation, but on **mathematical integrity, economic resilience, and user protection**. A protocol that truly represents the future of Intelligent Decentralized Finance and hence, sets a *New Standard for DeFi*.

Coincidentally, *NERGE* also conveys the idea of the merge of multiple protocols: DEX and Lending protocols into a single, unified system.
